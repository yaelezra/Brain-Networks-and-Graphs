# Brain-Networks-and-Graphs

This project is part from the final assignment in 'Brain Networks and Graphs' course. In the project, measures of graph theory were calculated and plotted using a functional connectivity map of the brain (resented across Juelich atlas).

packages I used: 
* numpy
* networkx
* matplotlib
